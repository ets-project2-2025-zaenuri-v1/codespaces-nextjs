     "message": "Database connection successful",
     "data": {
       "organizations": [
         {
           "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
           "name": "Pempek Palembang",
           "description": "Sample organization for testing"
         }
       ],
       "products": [

           "number": "MEJA-01",
           "capacity": 4
         }
       ],
       "timestamp": "2025-10-14T18:22:46.547Z"
     }
   }
   ```
